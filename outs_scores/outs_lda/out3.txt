This is accompanied by significant decrease in CHF. 1) Acute Renal Failure- She initially presented with a recent Cr=1.6, but this was definitely a change. The immediate but no infection. No evidence of casts under microscope. No RBC casts to suggest GN. ALso had a protein:creatinine ratio done team was consulted to help sort out her complicated picture. with no evidence of RBC casts. She also didn't appear abd/pelvis CT and abd U/S(except for benign cyst in L kidney). urine at reduced levels and never became oliguric. She did have rising daily. Many rheumatologically based etiologies were considered given her known Sjogren's, including: Sjogren's glomerulonephritis given the hematuria, despite absence of RBC team decided to perform renal biopsy. This was initially She was also given platelets before biopsy. In addition, ~5 prednisone. This did not appear to make a difference in her came back as mixed picture of the following: 1) Pauci-immune endo- and extra-capillary proliferative with associated necrotizing arteritis and hyalin deposits 2) Papillary cortical neoplasm. Comment: The complex findings in this biopsy are difficult to vasculitic process, however there is significantly more pauci-immune ANCA associated type of vasculitis. Possible evidence of immune complexes by immunofluorescence or electron infrequent. patients known Sjogren's syndrome. uncertain significance. If it is part of a larger neoplasm then entirely present in the core taken, then it is best considered a Around the same time, a 24 hour urine collection was sent for As she is small woman without much muscle mass, her Prot:Cr This, along with the biopsy, make her picture much more c/w a Pertinents include: neg Anti-Sm and RNP, making SLE less likely. neg-B2-glycoprotein.

She was weaned off urine per hour. positive cryoglobulins and low complement. No suggestion of prednisone and cytoxan, and she will be re-evaluated monthly to kidneys have recovered function. Her 1st dose of cytoxan was on guidance of Dr. . She will need to continue very slow daily dose by 5mg per week for 1 week, and then by 2.5mg per believed to be secondary to her volume overload status. She diltiazem in escalating doses. She was also started on isordil. normalize as her fluid level was decreased with UF, but then at the end of her admission for assistance in fluid management requirements are expected to decrease if her renal function d/c. If BP remains elevated, clonidine patch may be indicated over last several months, but has not been as bad here. biopsy considered but not done. Nerve conduction studies as was increased to 100 mg tid, but held there due to worry of stay went on. At d/c, she remains unable to walk on her feet on various possibilities to explain symptoms. Again, ultimate vasculitis vs SLE. Studies sent as above point away from SLE immunosuppressives and steroids with resulting improvement. 5) DVT-She had new RLE DVT by LENI on admission. RUE was ok. for various procedures but remained on otherwise. She had no HITT was considered, and pt was switched to Argatroban. HITT restarted, and platelets increased despite heparin infusion, so Reason for DVT not known, but was in bed for 3 months was not sent in acute setting. She was treated w/ coumadin for therapeutic at 2.8. She will require close monitoring of INR anticoagulation with goal INR . Total duration of therapy to had this long term. Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic away from Fe-def anemia. She was started on Epogen and received bleeding, and pt did have several bloody stools near end of colonoscopy and EGD which showed proctitis and for these findings, but did say could all be part of a was restarted and her Hct was monitored closely. HCT remained At d/c, HCT is stable w/ no evidence of bleeding. 7) ID-Her WBC ct climbed to ~25 after initiaition of prednisone. high dose prednisone. Started on levofloxacin several times for CXR due to heart failure obscuring image. This was eventually infection or not. Also, initiated Bactrim ppx for PCP given later due to concern that this was causing thrombocytopenia. No initially elevated LFTs, and hepatitis serologies were sent and of heart failure. 8) Pulmonary-As above, pt initially with heart failure due to was diuresed effectively with Lasix and pulmonary status and CXRs were c/w pulmonary edema. Escalating doses of lasix Her O2 was gradually turned up, and at this point, HD initiated. She had question of obscured consolidation on several CXRs, and stopped after several day course. Unknown whether had a true PNA as a result of hypoalbuminemia and volume overload. This was stopped. HTN as above. 10) Derm-She had palpable purpura on her arms and trunk during present and biopsied area on back. This showed "Necrotizing venule". Team felt was c/w a vasculitis or her Sjogren's. 11) Heme-Investigated possible hemolysis, and had low though, so not sure if accurate. Bilirubin always WNL. At d/c, transaminases. Can be caused by Sjogren's alone. Hepatitis had no abd pain. Likely all due to underlying problems and not symptomatic. This is believed to be related to her underlying started UF/HD. Again, she never developed symptoms. At d/c, continue fluid restriction to less than 2L per day, and reassess Paget's disease in pelvis. She was treated pamidronate IV for 15)Secondary Hyperparathyroidism:Pt had PTH level that was very calcitriol for this. Also on Tums as a phophate binder as 16) Thrombocytopenia: Pt had gradually dropping platelet levels antibody, but plts continued to drop off of heparin. Considered plt trajectory. Other considerations were Levaquin and after receiving Cytoxan for her proliferative GN, this is had been on Argatroban while ruling out HIT (had 2 negative HIT improved daily, now normalized at d/c. 17) Pneumonia: 1 week before d/c, she was observed to by this time. CXR demonstrated increased volume overload in the infiltrate. Given hypothermia and cough, she was treated At d/c, cough is improving and hypothermia has resolved, w/ She will need to continue vancomycin and zosyn after d/c to . 18) Communication: questions about this patient and her complex (, pager # ) Medications on Admission: Simvastatin 5 qday ASA 325 qday Calcium citrate po BID MVI Discharge Medications: 1.
