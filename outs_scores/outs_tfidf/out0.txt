She was found to have 2 vessel disease and Plavix 75mg daily, Simvastatin 80mg daily, and aspirin 325mg without complication. Her dose of Toprol XL was increased to She is also on lisinopril 5mg daily for blood pressure control. # Respiratory Failure: Patient presented intubated from an w/o contrast showed severe sarcoidosis, which appeared to have diagnosed with ventilator associated pneumonia, and had acute on and she was extubated . She was placed on BIPAP and At this point, it was decided that she would be DNR/DNI and she significantly improved and she was eventually weaned down back cannula.
