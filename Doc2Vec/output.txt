Admission Date:       Discharge Date:    Date of Birth:        Sex:  M  Service:    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancer treated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen with saturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recently admitted from  to  for presumed bronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough, shortness of breath and fevers.  During his last admission two weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten day Prednisone taper and Augmentin for one week.  He underwent bronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchial lesion, which was normal.  Sputum sample was done at that time showed no growth.  He was discharged at his baseline function on .  The plan was to treat him for one week of Augmentin, skip one week followed by Bactrim for one week, skip one week and then on Augmentin for two weeks for pneumonia prophylaxis.  The last dose of Augmentin was  after being on Augmentin for only three days.  He was doing well until approximately one week ago when he developed mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought was due to low potassium.  Within the following days he complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum.  He had a low grade temperature, mild headache and worsening cough and presented to the Emergency Department.  He denied any sinus pain, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria or joint pain.  In the Emergency Department he was febrile to 102 orally and had a heart rate of 160 and a blood pressure of 118/56.  Respiratory rate 28.  Sating 88 to 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  Initially he was stable, but then had a gradual change in mental status with hypoxia, which resulted in his elective intubation.  He received Lasix 100 mg intravenous twice, 1 mg of Bumex and 1 gram of Ceftriaxone as well as 125 mg of Solu-Medrol.  He was also placed on a heparin drip for a subtherapeutic INR and given morphine and Ativan for sedation.  Chest x-ray showed no focal pneumonia or evidence of heart failure.  The patient then underwent a CT angiogram of the chest that showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage three squamous cell lung cancer diagnosed in , status post right pneumonectomy in  treated with neoadjuvant radiation therapy and carboplatin and Taxol.  2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  3.  Congestive heart failure, last echocardiogram  with limited views showing grossly preserved left ventricular function and right ventricular function.  4.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  13.  Sleep apnea.  14.  Colonic polyps discovered in .  15. Hypercholesterolemia.  16.  Small pericardial effusion in , which subsequently resolved.  ALLERGIES:  Doxepin causes delirium and Levaquin causes prolonged QTs.  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Bactrim 800 mg/160 one tablet twice a day for one week skip one week and then Augmentin 500 mg three times a day.  Potassium 40 milliequivalents twice a day.  Protonix 40 mg once daily.  Lasix 160 mg b.i.d., Uniphyl 200 mg q.d., Zestril 2.5 mg q.d., Serevent two puffs b.i.d., Flovent 110 micrograms four puffs twice a day. Combivent inhaler two puffs four times a day.  Duo-neb solution four times a day as needed.  Amiodarone 200 mg q.d., enteric coated aspirin 325 mg a day, Glyburide 5 mg once a day, Colace 100 mg twice a day, Senna prn, Coumadin 5 mg once a day except for 4 mg on Tuesday and Thursday, Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d., Oxycontin 20 mg t.i.d., Paxil 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 10 mg q.d., Ambien 15 mg q.h.s. and a regular insulin sliding scale.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking in  following a forty year history of smoking three to four packs a day.  He consumed two to three drinks alcoholic drinks per day and was a construction worker.  FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer at the age of 39 and an older brother who had a coronary artery bypass graft.  His father also had coronary artery disease and he had a sister with cardiac valvular disease.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This was a gentleman who was intubated, sedated and responsive only to noxious stimuli. Pupils were unremarkable.  There were no bruits in the neck. Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, faint heart sounds overall.  Occasional ectopic beats. Lungs were clear to auscultation on the left with transmitted breath sounds on the right.  Abdomen was soft and mildly distended with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities showed no evidence of ulcers, trace edema in both lower extremities and no cyanosis or clubbing.  Skin showed no evidence of rashes.  LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  Urinalysis was unremarkable.  White blood cell count 23, hematocrit 42, platelets were 297.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon admission to the hospital the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was treated for presumed bronchitis versus tracheobronchitis versus atypical pneumonia.  Blood sputum, urine and stool cultures were sent and Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin were started.  1.  Infectious disease:  The patient did not develop a focal infiltration throughout his hospitalization.  His Ceftriaxone was stopped and he was continued on Azithromycin.  He remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital stay and his white blood cell count decreased daily.  On hospital day two he was stable for extubation and tolerated extubation very well.  He was then transferred on hospital day number three out of the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor. He continued to improve clinically with a decrease in his fever curve and decrease in his oxygen requirements.  He also subjectively improved and on his last hospital day he was comfortable and ambulating without oxygen.  He stated that he had come back to his baseline.  White blood cell count returned to  range, and cultures were negative except for one anaerobic bottle that was growing gram positive coxae that had been unidentified by the time of discharge.  2.  Pulmonary:  This was treated as possible tracheobronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease versus atypical pneumonia.  The patient was kept on his usual inhaler and nebulizing medications as well as Azithromycin and intravenous Solu-Medrol.  After hospital day number two and the patient was extubated and improving the Solu-Medrol was switched to Prednisone and was rapidly tapered.  The patient was encouraged to ambulate and was given regular respiratory treatment and chest physical therapy.  By the end of the hospitalization the patient felt that he had returned to his baseline lung function, baseline pulmonary function and was coughing up less dark sputum.  To manage his congestive heart failure Lasix was used judiciously in order to gently diurese him over the course of the hospitalization followed by urine output and daily weights.  The patient responded to this well and felt overall that his symptoms of volume overload had improved.  3.  Cardiovascular:  Based on his presentation, it was not clear that there was not a cardiac component causing his change in his status, so cardiac enzymes were sent.  Three sets of enzymes were negative and showed no evidence of myocardial infarction.  He had a number of electrocardiograms that were checked to ensure that he did not have a significantly prolonged QTC interval and that it was not worse.  4.  Endocrine:  The patient was followed with blood glucose measurements that showed that his glucose was under poor control with the Glyburide and the regular insulin sliding scale.  As the regular insulin sliding scale was increased and the Prednisone was tapered these values returned closer to normal.  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Improved.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

Admission Date:       Discharge Date:    Date of Birth:        Sex:  M  Service:  CCU/MEDICAL ICU/C-MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old man with a history of stage III squamous lung carcinoma, status post lobectomy and pneumonectomy on the right earlier this year, who was transferred to  for respiratory failure.  Two weeks prior to admission, the patient began experiencing episodes of shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea.  Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram performed at that time were reportedly unremarkable.  On , after coming home from his son's wedding, the patient became acutely short of breath, agitated and collapsed on the floor, stating that he could not breathe. His family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the field and taken to  Hospital where a chest x-ray was reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new left bundle branch block, ST elevations in leads II through V4 and Q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which was new.  He was transferred to the  and Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation and management.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer at the age of 39, and an older brother status post coronary artery bypass graft.  His father also had coronary artery disease and a sister has cardiac valve disease.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking three months ago following three to four packs per day times forty years.  He consumed two to three drinks per day.  He is a construction worker.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 99, heart rate 70 to 80s, blood pressure 110/60, oxygen saturation 95%. In general, the patient was intubated and sedated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination indicated the pupils 2.0 millimeters and reactive bilaterally.  Endotracheal tube is in place.  Cardiovascular - tachycardia with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary examination - The patient had diffuse coarse rhonchi on the left and absent breath sounds on the right.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normal bowel sounds.  The extremities were warm with 1+ distal pulses.  LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies at the outside hospital indicated that he had a white blood cell count of 11.4, hematocrit 41.0, platelets 466,000.  The differential on the white blood cell count was 74% polys, 15% lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes.  Chem7 indicated a sodium of 136, potassium 5.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, blood urea nitrogen 12, creatinine 1.3, glucose 285.  Prothrombin time was 22.4, partial thromboplastin time 37.4, INR 3.0.  Arterial blood gases indicated a pH of 7.29, paCO2 of 54, paO2 of 506 on a 100% FIO2.  Urinalysis was within normal limits.  CKs were 41 and 57 with a troponin of 0.04 and then 0.6.  Chest x-ray indicated status post right pneumonectomy with no infiltrate and mild vascular engorgement.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he later ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 4.5 and flat CKs.  A Transesophageal echocardiogram indicated an ejection fraction of 25% and apical hypokinesis.  The patient was also noted to develop new onset rapid atrial fibrillation with associated hypotension and was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm but remained hypotensive requiring pressors.  A CT angiogram was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.  On , a PA catheter was inserted which indicated decreased central venous pressure and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure consistent with septic shock.  The patient concurrently developed a temperature to 100 to 101 while urine culture grew E. coli.  The patient was started on intravenous Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Tobramycin and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received intravenous fluids and was changed from Levophed to vasopressin with good effect.  On , the pressors were weaned.  Bronchoscopy was performed which indicated intact suture sites with some thick secretions.  On , the patient was successfully extubated.  Over the weekend of , and , the patient defervesced with decreasing white blood count and was successfully switched to oral medications with stable blood pressure.  His antibiotics other than Levaquin were discontinued.  The patient was then transferred to the C-Medicine service for workup of coronary artery disease.  Cardiac catheterization indicated 30% mid right coronary artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.  The patient was titrated up on a beta blocker ace inhibitor.  Lipid panel indicated a total cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 137, LDL of 133 and HDL of 41.  He was therefore started on statin therapy for hypercholesterolemia.  The patient was worked up for anemia with hematocrit in the 30.0s during his stay in the C-Medicine service and was found to have an iron of 22, ferritin of 459, TIBC of 228, transferrin of 175. These findings were consistent with anemia of chronic disease and thought secondary to his lung cancer.  On the C-Medicine service, the patient was noted to have bilateral carotid bruits.  Carotid Doppler studies were performed which indicated less than 40% bilateral stenosis and mild plaquing bilaterally.  The patient was maintained on Heparin during his hospital course and started on Coumadin two days prior to anticipated discharge with plan to discharge to home on Lovenox until the patient reached a therapeutic INR of 2.0 to 3.0.  From an endocrine perspective, the patient was treated with regular insulin sliding scale for his diabetes mellitus with a plan to transition back to his home regimen of Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.  Fingerstick blood sugar indicated good glycemic control during hospital course.  A physical therapy consultation was arranged and at the time of discharge dictation, it was anticipated that the patient would be deemed safe for discharge to home with outpatient physical therapy follow-up.  At the time of dictation, the patient was planned to be discharged to home with VNA.  He was also to follow-up in  Clinic for an INR check on the day following discharge and was to follow-up with his primary care physician in  firm. He was to complete a fourteen day course of Levaquin, which had been switched to p.o. on the day prior to his discharge in order to treat his urinary tract infection.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Urosepsis. 2.  Acute myocardial infarction, status post cardiac catheterization indicating 30% mid right coronary artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex. 3.

The patient was OB positive in the Emergency Department.  Extremities revealed 1+ pedal edema with venostasis changes bilaterally.  Skin examination had no rashes.  The patient s alert and oriented times three with a chronic left foot drop.  INITIAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit 31.4, which then dropped to 24.3, baseline is 41.  Platelets 138.  SMA 7 notable for a sodium of 136, K of 4.7, bicarb 24, BUN 32, creatinine 0.5, glucose 158, INR 2.3.  Dilantin level was 3.0.  ALT 35, AST 51, alkaline phosphatase 203.  Total bilirubin .5, LDH 215, albumin 3.0.  Enzymes were cycled, which were negative.  The patient's electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, PR prolongation at 206.  Left axis deviation, inferior Qs, all of which were old.   There were some new T wave flattening in V2 to V6.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient was admitted with melena likely an upper gastrointestinal bleed given history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, question of enteric fistula.  Given history of hemochromatosis and early cirrhosis, question of varices, given history of reflux symptoms, question of esophagitis, gastritis.  The patient was again admitted with gastrointestinal bleed and was typed and crossed.  He was initially transfused 2 units for a hematocrit of 24.  He had two peripheral intravenouses in place.  INR was corrected with vitamin K 2 mg and 4 units of fresh frozen platelets and hematocrit revealed a change from 24 up to 26 after 4 units.  INR corrected to 1.7.  The patient  was also started on Protonix 40 intravenous b.i.d. Aspirin and Coumadin  were held.  The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the following morning, which revealed grade 1 esophageal varices and mild gastritis esophagitis as well as portal gastropathy.  There was no active bleeding at any site.  The patient then underwent an abdominal CT, which was negative for aortic enteric fistula. On the following day the patient underwent a colonoscopy, which was normal up until the ascending colon.  However, they were not able to go all the way to the cecum and recommended virtual colonoscopy in the future and the patient had then underwent a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding times four to the esophageal varices.  The patient will need a repeat banding procedure in ten days.  After the banding the patient was started on Sucralfate 1 gram q.i.d. and was continued on Protonix.

Hypotension:  The patient was initially in the systolics in the 90s likely hypovolemic in the setting of a gastrointestinal bleed.  However, given the history of cardiac disease the patient's enzymes were cycled times three, which were negative.  He was resuscitated with fluid, fresh frozen platelets and packed red cells and blood pressure remained stable throughout.  After the esophagogastroduodenoscopy the Atenolol was switched to Nadolol given the history of cirrhosis and varices and Zestril was held up until discharge due to low blood pressures.  3.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient with a history of myocardial infarction in  and  and is status post stent of the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in .  Enzymes were cycled, which were negative.  Aspirin and Coumadin were held due to gastrointestinal bleed.  Beta blocker and ace were initially held due to low blood pressures.  Lipitor was held secondary to new cirrhosis.  The patient was restarted on Nadolol upon discharge, however, aspirin, Coumadin, Zestril and Lipitor were held prior to discharge to be restarted by primary care physician at his or her discretion.  4.  Deep venous thrombosis:  Patient with recurrent left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, but admitted with gastrointestinal bleed.  INR 2.3, Coumadin was held due to multiple procedures and held upon discharge.  The patient will undergo repeat banding in ten days after which time the patient may or may not resume anticoagulation per primary care physician.  5.  Hemachromatosis:  The patient with hemachromatosis for long standing, now with evidence of cirrhosis on examination.

Admission Date:                Discharge Date:      Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending: Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: F Russian-speaking h/o refractory nodular sclerosing Hodgkins Lymphoma was brought in by EMS and admitted after her home health care aide noted she was hypotensive to 88/40 and confused.  In the ED, T 98.4 (rectal), HR 101, BP 102/53, RR 20, O2Sat 98% on 3L. Incontinant of guaiac-positive stool.  Treated with 4 L NS, vanco 1g IV, ceftazadime 1g IV, and flagyl 500mg IV. Received 0.5 mg ativan and 2mg IV morphine for agitation.  Pt was admitted to  where she completed a 10-day course of ceftazadime and vancomycin for urosepsis. A 7-day course of metronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C. Diff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count, although all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and was transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of transfer, active issues were poor nutritional status, thrombocytopenia and anemia.  On the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib with RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as respiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation. There was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she had pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt digoxin was not recommended.  Pt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.  While in the MICU, she was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam as she had (1) sites of possible infection at the erosions under her breasts and on her right hip, as well as question of PNA, (2) rising WBC, reaching a high of nearly 17.  MICU course was also marked by (1) hypotension, which responded to gentle NS boluses; (2) low UOP believed to be  both hypovolemia and a low baseline nitrogenous load/obligate urine output; and (3) recurrent Afib, for which she was transitioned to amiodarone 400mg PO daily, to run for 7 days before titrating downward.

Routine PA and lateral films are recommended for evaluation when feasible.  .  Echo. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  Based on  AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.  Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of , there is no definite change.  Brief Hospital Course: F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially admitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with hypotension and AFib with RVR.  # Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with many family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On  the patient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU transfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the patient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on . She was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a decision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.  Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on . The family declined autopsy.  # Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to 150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous conversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses and bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin considered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was started on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When the patient was readmitted to the ICU on , she was having increased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.   # Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and thrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be secondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused total of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on  and ) with a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend platelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10. Transfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on .  Also, the patient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total of four units since ).  # Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to fluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV relaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for distributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was started on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was again hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary to systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a decision was then made to not escalate care.  # Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious sources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions under breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz started on ; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not obtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff neg, thus D/C flagyl .  Now with GNR from skin swab.  # Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since admission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been getting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have not been able to keep up her free water intake.  # Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline on admission most likely  metabolic encephalopathy due to infection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after resolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process. Thyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick euthyroid syndrome.  # Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient developed labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for hypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide gtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated respiratory distress.  On  she was on the floor and had a witnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While in the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had increasing O2 requirements.  # Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on admission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of 0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due to sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was hypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought secondary to ATN.  # Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg IV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home dose 1/4.  # Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural effusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low albumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake. Diuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed above.  Continue to monitor.  # Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis requiring pressor support. Urine cultures from  were positive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx  grew out yeast, which was not treated.  Another repeat UCx  final again grew out yeast.  # Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan. There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head secondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable destruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and surrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain is being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.  # Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to agressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and hypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese in MICU due to development of hypotension in response to furosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from , unchanged on  CXR.  # Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no interventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration causing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic count and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per oncology.  # Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency. Encourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.    Medications on Admission: Medications on Admission: 1.

The pt reports development of sob similar to his previous episodes of COPD/PNA. 2-3days ago, he subsequently developed cough productive of yellow-green sputum along with subjective fevers, chills, and diaphoresis. He also developed some pleuritic chest pain several days ago. The chest pain was located in the left side of the chest below the nipple line and occurred with deep inspiration. The pt reports these are all similar to previous episodes of COPD exacerbation. The pt had tried nebulizers Q4hours in addition to 2L NC one day PTA without any improvement. The pt uses oxygen at home 40% of the time, mostly when he is active. The pt noted inc. DOE even with the oxygen prior to this episode. The pt does admit to one episode of vomiting in the ED, which was thought to be secondary to meds he received in the ED. The pt denies HA, abd pain, diarrhea.   In the ED, the pt was febrile to 101 rectally, requiring 5liters oxygen to keep sats >96%. He was given ceftriaxone, azithromycin, bactrim and solumedrol with continuouos nebs for PNA vs. COPD flare. He had one episode of emesis in ED. The pt also received a CTA which ruled out a PE (given the concern for pleuritic chest pain). ABG in the ED was: 7.44/40/81--> 7.49/40/67.

He had 1.  Exploratory laparotomy. 2.  Pancreatic debridement with wide drainage. 3.  Open cholecystectomy. 4.  Placement of a combined G/J tube (MIC tube).  Post-op he stayed in the ICU for 2 nights and was trasnfered to the floor on POD 3.  GI/Abd: He was NPO with a NGT and IVF. The NGT was removed on POD 2. His G-tube was left to gravity drainage. His J-tube was capped and then trophic tubefeedings were started on POD 2. His tubefeedings were advanced to a goal of Replete with Fiber 3/4 strength at 80cc/hr. He had 3 JP drains in place and these were draining thick, dark fluid. He continued to have high output from these drains. He was started on sips on POD 5, he was advanced to clears on POD 6. JP amylase was checked on POD 7, once on a full liquid diet. His JP Amylase was 27K, 34K, and 14K. He was made NPO due to his JP amylase reported as high. He continued on the tubefeedings. A grape juice test was positive for a leak from around the JP drains. He had one small spot with minimal drainage that could be expressed from his incision. His is now having drainage around all his drains and g/j tube with mild skin irritation. He has irritation around the tube extending out from ~0.5 - 3 cm and appears at  to develop yeast. His midline incision is c/i but has a small amount of serous drainage on the gauze.  Have suggested using Criticaid anti fungal moisture barrier to protect his skin from the drainage and to prevent the formation of yeast. Continue to apply a thin layer of dressing around the drains and change as needed do not allow the gauze to become saturated with drainage. Apply the antifungal Criticaid two to three times/day.   A CT was obtained on  and showed: 1. Heterogeneity in the region of the pancreas consistent with the patient's previous necrotizing pancreatitis. 2. Three surgical drains in situ with some high attenuation in the region of the lesser sac which may represent fistulization from the small bowel into this residual collection. 3. Loculated fluid under the anterior abdominal wall measuring 16 cm. 4. Gastrojejunostomy in situ. 5. Renal cysts. 6. Bilateral pleural effusions. 7. Enlarged prostate at 8 cm. . He will remain NPO with TF for 2 weeks and then return for a repeat CT. His drains will remain and the drainage will be monitored.  Pain: He had good pain control with a PCA. He continued on a PCA thru POD 6. Once back on a diet, he was ordered for PO pain meds with good control.  Labs: We monitored his labs and his Tbili decreased from a high of 2.6 on POD 2 to WNL by .  Cards: He was being followed by his PCP/Cardiologist. He was put back on his home meds on POD5, including Lasix IV for gentle diuresis and his heart meds.  Renal: He was diuresing well and continued to have negative fluid balance and losing weight appropriately.

Rigid bronchoscopy, debridement, T-tube placement. 2. Baclofen Pump Removal. 3. RUQ Hematoma Evacuation. 4. Percutaneous Gastrostomy Tube. 5. Left Antecubital PICC Line.   History of Present Illness: Ms.  is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive MS  in  with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump placment in ', s/p tracheostomy in '  to chronic respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her nursing home.  According to notes from , the pt was found at her nursing home yesterday () AM, shaking her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed seizure). She was taken by EMS to  ED. . In the ED at , pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR 12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB. Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV ventilation. Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin, Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir. On exam, it was noted that the skin overlying the baclofen pump (RUQ) appeared inflamed. Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia of 20%. U/A with 50-100 WBC, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. LP was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys, glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+ cocci. Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in  bottles. Micro lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was positive for group B strep. Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given. Hydrocortisone 80mg was also given. Left SC line and NGT were also placed at . CXR showed cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT was negative for an abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. Head CT showed questionable changes from prior that might suggest the possibility of a right MCA infarct. Pt was transferred directly to the  MICU for further management.   Past Medical History: PMH: 1. Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in  when pt was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump (') for spasticity 2. Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought  to chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. Last admitted  for urosepsis 3. Recurrent aspiration PNA - ,  - admitted both times requiring MICU stay, during ' admission trach was placed because was unable to clear secretions on her own  to respiratory weakness 1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if  to aspiration 4. COPD 5. HTN 6. Osteoporosis 7. Scarlet fever as a child 8.  Chronic constipation 9. Hx of sacral decubitus ulcer   Social History: Social History: Pt is widowed. She has no children.

TTE on admission: 1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 2. No obvious mass or vegetation seen. . CT abd post-op: 1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal wall. No extension into the peritoneal space is seen. The covering intern was notified by telephone at 10:30 a.m. on , .  2) Gallbladder with dense material . this could represent stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. If clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further characterization.  3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.  4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases. . EEG : This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the  presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized slowing followed by periods of suppression. In addition, there were independent bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe encephalopathy. A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of the encephalopathy. . EEG : This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage II sleep with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of intermittent and independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both sides. This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. In addition, exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the underlying infection. . MRI : Increased signal along the occipital horns could be due to cellular debris from meningitis. No evidence of acute infarct seen. Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild communicating hydrocephalus. . MRV : The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of thrombosis. Deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow signal. . MRA : Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion. No evidence of vascular occlusion seen. . TEE: 1.The left atrium is normal in size. 2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. 6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. . Head CT : Stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci.   Brief Hospital Course: 1. GBS meningitis/bactermia In the unit, the pt was continued on Ampicillin and started on Gentamicin (for synergy). Her intrathecal baclofen pump was thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying pump in RUQ). Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the operation appeared to be without complication. The following day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be hypotensive with an SBP of 70. After spiking a temp, it was thought that she might be septic. She was given fluids, PRBCs, FFP, and placed on Levophed. Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site. Pt was taken emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized. She returned to the floor and remained hemodynamically stable. Given 1 additional unit of PRBCs. Her hct bumped appropriately and remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course. Pt developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought to be  to PCN allergy. Amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly with Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone. Repeat LP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ. opening eyes to name). CSF analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis. Prior to leaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2. She was pancultured and all cultures were negative. A TTE ruled out endocarditis in the setting of group B strep bacteremia.  On day #12 of gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of her treatment course. . 2. RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to be bleeding into the RUQ pocket.  She was taken to the OR for emergent evacuation of the hematoma.  On POD #16, pt was noted to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her RUQ. Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but found a new fluid collection.  Surgery was consulted and they diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given that it had no signs of infection. . 3. Pneumonia: Towards the end of the pt's ICU stay, she was evaluated by speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the passy-muir valve.  She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent for culture.  The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram negative rods (not pseudomonas).  She was started on vancomycin for MRSA and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR. Once the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas, ceftaz was stopped.  Of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that were persistently high.  Vancomycin troughs should be checked often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.  After the pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was assumed that the pt aspirated.  That day she also spiked a temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage. Vancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on  (14-day course) and Flagyl's course will be complete on  (after 10 days). . 4. Supraglottic edema As above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she failed a passy-muir valve.  On bronchoscopy it was noted that she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.  She was taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed. ENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to evaluate her anatomy.  The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.  Ideally, she will get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the patient has recovered from her acute illnesses. . 5. Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease. Pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct drop after the bleed in the RUQ pocket, pt's hct remained stable. . 6. Multiple sclerosis Pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal. She was without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e. incr HR, temp, BP, seizures) once pump was removed. She continued on Baclofen 20mg qid po with an Ativan taper. PO baclofen was then tapered to 20mg tid. . 7. Mental status At baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by MS, she is alert, oriented, and conversant. Her decreased responsiveness was thought to be  to meningitis, but although pt seemed to have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished reponsiveness persisted. Repeat LP in the unit suggested a resolving meningitis.  Neurology was following the pt and recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ? of stroke at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule out subclinical seizures.  An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.  An MRI was finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke. Towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and eventually returned to her baseline mental status.  Pt's mental status remained at baseline and pt will follow-up with neurology as an outpatient. . 8. Respiratory status After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated. (At baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis but does not require mechical ventilation. Trach in place to help with clearance of secretions.)  Pt placed on A/C in unit, then transferred to CPAP and eventually placed on a trach mask with good results.  At time of discharge, she was satting well on 40% trach mask. . 9. HTN In unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay became hypertensive with SBPs in the 150-170s. Pt has hx of hypertension. Unclear whether BP was rebounding from baclofen d/c. BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg . . 10. Sacral decub ulcer: Stage 1-2.  Wound care nurse followed while pt was in-house. . 11. FEN: During pt's acute illness, she had an NGT placed. Speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids and pureed food.  The following day, she was noted to have soup coming out of her trach so she was again made NPO.  Pt then passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration after trying some ground solids.  She was made NPO and GI placed a PEG for feeding.  Pt should remain on tube feeds until her tracheal swelling is much improved.  At that point, another swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po feeding. . 12.
