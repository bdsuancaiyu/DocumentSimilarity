Admission Date:         Discharge Date:    Date of Birth:          Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in , six hospitalizations since , last discharged on , with the diagnosis of tracheal bronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, versus atypical pneumonia, status post intubation in the MICU, chronic secretions/congestion-related problems, on alternating regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim since  for multiple bronchitic-like infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, prior PEs, diabetes type 2, status post myocardial infarction, who presented with gradual shortness of breath beginning on the day of admission.  The patient reported a  day history of general fatigue. On the day of admission, visiting nurse services reported a systolic blood pressure of 70.  The wife drove the patient to the Emergency Room.  The patient also complained of some dizziness, however denied other symptoms including fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms.  He reported good p.o. intake and appetite.  The patient reported that he has a chronic, slight cough, however, denied any sputum production.  He took his oral temperature at home and denied any fever.  At home, the patient is on oxygen of  L via nasal cannula.  The patient recently finished a steroid taper on  which was two weeks in length.  He reported a usual SBP of 80-110.  The patient did note that since , a Scopolamine patch was added to his regimen and has increased his secretions significantly.  EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Per Emergency Room, the patient appeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placed on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an ABG of 7.46, pCO2 of 48, and pO2 of 33.  There was a question if this was a venous gas or not.  Lasix 100 mg IV, Albuterol nebs, Solu-Medrol 600 mg IV, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV was given to the patient.  When evaluated by the MICU shortly after arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was weaned down to baseline of 2 L oxygen with oxygen saturation of 100% via nasal cannula.  The patient was breathing comfortably at 18-20 breaths/min.  The patient no longer complained of shortness of breath but did state that he felt slightly tired.  Chest x-ray was negative, and a CT showed no acute PE.  The patient reported that he was back to baseline in the Emergency Room.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage III squamous cell lung cancer diagnosis in , status post right pneumonectomy in , with radiation, Carboplatin, and Taxol treatments.  2.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister died at age 39 of cancer.  Brother is status post coronary artery bypass grafting.  Father with history of coronary artery disease.  Sister with heart valve disease.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.5??????, heart rate 70, blood pressure 89-122/60-77, respirations 19-20, oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L nasal cannula.  General:  The patient was in no apparent respiratory distress.  He was comfortable.  He was alert and awake.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  Distant heart sounds. Without murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  Loud rhonchi throughout the left lung field.  No apparent wheezing or rubs.  Transmitted sounds to right side.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.4, hematocrit 30.0, which is baseline, platelet count 388; CHEM7 was unremarkable; PT 22.5, PTT 31.3, INR 3.5; B12 327, folate 12.7.  Electrocardiogram unchanged from prior.  Theophylline level 4.3.  Chest x-ray showed status post right pneumonectomy, left lung with no congestive heart failure, no pneumonia, no pneumothorax, no effusion.  CT angiogram showed no acute PE, possible chronic PE in pulmonary artery segment in the left lower lobe that is not occlusive.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of lung carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations since  for bronchitic-like infections, on chronic alternating antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim, recent hospitalization in MICU with intubation, chronic secretions, and congestive-related problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on home oxygen, congestive heart failure, prior PEs, history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with respiratory distress.  1.  Respiratory distress:  The patient was given Lasix, Albuterol nebs, and Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department and had rapid improvement of his symptoms.  It was thought that the patient's acute respiratory distress was most likely secondary to mucous plugging.  PE was ruled out by CTA. Chest x-ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  The patient also recently completed a steroid taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this admission.  He had no cough and no sputum production and no fevers.  The patient was rapidly tapered off of steroids, as it was thought that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was unlikely to be the cause of his acute respiratory distress and because it was unclear whether steroids was really benefitting this patient.  He continued to have aggressive chest physical therapy for secretion management and was continued on his Scopolamine patch, Serevent, Combivent, Atrovent/Albuterol nebs, and inhalers.  He was also continued on his alternating prophylactic antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim.  He continued to do well and recorded oxygen saturations of greater than 92%.  On the day of discharge, oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.  Of note, the patient was observed in the MICU overnight but was discharged to the floor quickly and had no other episodes of respiratory distress.  2.  Hypotension:  The visiting nurse noted a systolic blood pressure of 70; however, by the time the patient came to the Emergency Room, he had an SBP of 90.  It was thought that the patient's slightly decreased SBP was secondary to hypovolemia.  He was given gentle fluid hydration.  He also had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid taper; however, this was done after Solu-Medrol had been given to the patient.  It was reportedly negative, but it was unclear as to how accurate this is in the setting of recent Solu-Medrol dosing.  His Lasix was decreased from 160 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d., and his ACE inhibitor was discontinued.  He continued to remain normovolemic during the rest of his hospitalization.  3.  Cardiovascular:  In terms of the patient's history of perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his Amiodarone and Lasix 80 mg b.i.d.   He also continued Aspirin and Lipitor.  His electrocardiogram was unchanged, and it was thought that there was not any significant cardiac component to the patient's respiratory distress.  4.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on his Glyburide and was covered with an Insulin sliding scale in the hospital.  5.  History of pulmonary embolus:  The patient was continued on his Coumadin while in-house.  No further work-up was done.  6.  CODE STATUS:  THE PATIENT IS FULL CODE.  DISPOSITION:  He will be discharged to pulmonary rehabilitation to try to maximize his pulmonary status.  He appears to be doing very well with physical therapy during this hospitalization and has slightly improved his exercise tolerance.  He will also be started on a Morphine Elixir 5-10 mg sublingually p.r.n. q.6 hours for shortness of breath to relieve the patient's symptom of air hunger.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 2.  Mucous plugging. 3.  Congestive heart failure. 4.  Hypotension. 5.  Diabetes type 2. 6.  History of pulmonary embolus on Coumadin therapy.  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient will be discharged to pulmonary rehabilitation.  FOLLOW-UP:  He will follow-up with Dr.  and his primary care physician .  .

Admission Date:         Discharge Date:    Date of Birth:          Sex:  M  Service:    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, status post right pneumonectomy in , complicated by pulmonary artery laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and suctioning who was in his usual state of health until  when he developed nausea, lower abdominal pain, and projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis. He presented to the  Emergency Room on .  At that time he denied diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, hematochezia and bright red blood per rectum.  He had dark stools at baseline secondary to iron use.  The stool was found to be guaiac positive in the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency Department also his hematocrit value was 19, down from a baseline of 31 one month previously and he was coagulopathic with an INR of 9.8.  Attempts to place a nasogastric tube in the Emergency Department were unsuccessful.  While in the Emergency Department, he was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and got 2 mg of subcutaneous Vitamin K.  The patient was admitted to the Medicine Floor.  Repeat hematocrit several hours later dropped to a value of 13.  The nasogastric tube was placed on the floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood. He was, at that point, transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Workup while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without fresh blood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7 cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately 25 cm.  There was no evidence of stigmata of recent bleeding. He was stabilized with a total of seven units of packed red blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets.  He also received intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline.  Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative for diverticuli, perforation or retroperitoneal bleed. Colonoscopy performed later in the hospital course showed some polyps, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon.  Internal hemorrhoids were noted but no stigmata of recent bleeding.  The patient's coagulopathy was improving.  His hematocrit was stable, and he was transferred to the General Medicine Floor on .  Of note, prior to transfer he developed swelling of the right upper extremity and complained of pain of the right upper extremity.  Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed evidence of a right axillary deep vein thrombosis.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife, retired, worked previously in construction.  He reports a 160 pack year tobacco history, quit in , quit alcohol in .  No history of intravenous drug use.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs with temperature of 96.8, blood pressure 90/55, heart rate 90, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 96% on 3 liters.  General appearance:  Well developed, obese white male, pleasant, comfortable in no acute distress. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Sclera and conjunctiva anicteric. Conjunctiva not injected.  Oropharynx clear.   mucosa dry.  Neck:  Supple, no masses or lymphadenopathy. Tracheostomy site, clean, dry and intact.  Lungs:  Right lung with no breath sounds, left lung with fair air movement, transmitted upper airway sounds, scattered rhonchi. Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 heart sounds auscultated, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen: Soft, mildly tender to palpation, nondistended, positive normoactive bowel sounds.  No rebound or guarding. Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurological examination:  Nonfocal.  LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data upon admission revealed complete blood count demonstrated a white blood cell count 19.2, hematocrit 19.0, platelets 381.  Coagulation profile showed PT 38.5, PTT 38.0, INR 9.8.  Serum chemistries showed sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 96, bicarbonate 30, BUN 52, creatinine 1.3, glucose 196.  Liver function tests showed ALT 18, AST 26, amylase 23, lipase 24, albumin 3.4, alkaline phosphatase 100.  Cardiac enzymes showed creatinine kinase 82, troponin I 0.04.  Chest x-ray was negative for any acute pulmonary process.  Abdominal x-ray demonstrated opacification of the right lung base.  The left lung base was clear.  There was no free air in the abdomen.  There was a large amount of fecal material in the right colon.  There was a normal bowel gas pattern.  There was no evidence of obstruction.  Later computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no intra-abdominal abscess, bowel inflammation, evidence of perforated ulcer, appendicitis or diverticulitis.  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats/minute, normal axis, prolonged QT interval, no left ventricular hypertrophy, T wave inversions were noted in leads V1 and V2 which were new. No acute ST elevations or depressions noted.  This was compared with the prior electrocardiogram from .  HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 63 year old male with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in  complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and suctioning.  He was in his usual state of health until  when he developed nausea, lower abdominal pain, projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.  His hematocrit dropped from 31 to a nadir of 13.  His gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  1.  Anemia secondary to acute blood loss - The patient's gastrointestinal workup included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one without source of frank bleed.  However, in light of his initial complaints of nausea, abdominal pain, and guaiac positive stool a gastrointestinal source was still suspected. Physically the small bowel could be the source.  After stabilization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood products, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, he was transferred to the Medicine Floor after having stable hematocrit for greater than 24 hours.  While on the floor, his hematocrit was checked initially every 12 hours.  After demonstrating stability for a total of 72 hours it was spaced out to q. day hematocrit checks.  All told the patient received 7 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets during his hospital stay.  On , the patient underwent repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples of the esophageal nodule, not noted on previous study.  At the time of this dictation results of those biopsies were pending.  While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia.  He had a normal left ventricular hypertrophy, haptoglobin and bilirubin on admission, however, making hemolysis a very unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of 19. Moreover, no schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear. Hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his hospital course and were consistent with changes status post large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing hemolysis.  2.  Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis - On  the patient began to complain of right upper extremity pain and swelling.  Doppler ultrasound demonstrated an axillary deep vein thrombosis.  In light of his recent bleeding episode, anticoagulation was held initially. Although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses, there was still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of the patient's history of right pneumonectomy and the functionality of his one remaining lung.  The computerized tomography scan was performed to better examine the right upper extremity soft tissues.  In particular there was concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass lesion or fibrosis-post his pneumonectomy that could be contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep vein thrombosis formation.  Computerized tomographic venogram was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis, however.  The patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in the setting of his acute bleed for only several days, there was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses.  Therefore, an inferior vena cava filter was placed on . The patient tolerated the procedure well.  On , the patient then began to complain of pain and swelling of the right lower extremity.  Examination was consistent with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity. However, as the patient already had an inferior vena cava filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all, the decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging of the right lower extremity.  In light of his probable hypercoagulability, decision was made to reinitiate anticoagulation with the Coumadin.  His Coumadin level will be followed by his outpatient physician, .  . His INR should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a goal INR of 2 to 3.  3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/lung carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy - The patient was continued on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary toilet.  He was continued on his outpatient medicines, Combivent, Salmeterol, and Theophylline.  He was continued on antibiotic prophylaxis with Bactrim Double Strength in light of his history of bronchiectasis.  He was monitored for acute decompensation and his respiratory status, particularly concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.  He continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint.  He was diuresed gently after arriving to the Medicine Floor status post fluid resuscitation and blood product administration in the Medical Intensive Care Unit in the setting of his acute bleed.  With the diuresis, pulmonary toilet and supportive care, his respiratory status improved somewhat.  However, he is not back to his baseline of 2 liters of oxygen nasal cannula at home.  At the time of discharge he was maintaining saturations in the 97 to 100% range on 4 liters but he continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and shortness of breath, occasionally at rest.  It was felt that a lot the patient's dyspnea was secondary to muscle deconditioning due to his prolonged illness and hospital stay.  Therefore he will be discharged to a pulmonary rehabilitation program in hopes of increasing his conditioning and improving his overall pulmonary status.  4.  Diabetes mellitus 2 - The patient was maintained on a diabetic diet, with q.i.d. fingersticks, fingerstick blood glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding scale.  He was maintained on his outpatient dose of Neurontin for neuropathy.  5.  Atrial fibrillation - He was continued on his outpatient dose of Amiodarone.  Of note, he is currently in sinus rhythm.  6.  Acute renal failure - The patient on admission had an elevated creatinine level above his baseline.  This was likely secondary to prerenal causes, specifically hypovolemia and intravascular volume depletion in the setting of his acute bleeding episode.  His acute renal failure resolved after fluid hydration.  7.  Vitamin B12 deficiency - The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of supplementation with Vitamin B12, 1000 mcg p.o. b.i.d.  8.  Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.  9.  Depression/anxiety - The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Paroxetine 20 mg p.o. q.d.  10.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was fed a diabetic heart-healthy diet.  He received supplementation with multivitamins and Vitamin B12.  Electrolytes were aggressively repleted.  At the time of discharge he was tolerating regular diet without nausea, vomiting or other incident.  DISPOSITION:  With the patient's general deconditioning as well as his pulmonary status being slightly below his baseline I felt that he would benefit from an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program.  He will be discharged to such a program.  DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Hemodynamically stable.  Afebrile. Oxygen saturation stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula, ambulating independently, tolerating  intake without nausea or vomiting.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to an extended care facility.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Anemia due to acute blood loss, likely secondary to gastrointestinal bleed. 2.

He will follow up on the biopsy results from the patient's last esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  The patient should have his INR level checked daily while at the rehabilitation facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted appropriately with goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.                                  , M.D.    Dictated By: MEDQUIST36  D:    20:17 T:    21:42 JOB#:   

Admission Date:       Discharge Date:    Date of Birth:        Sex:  M  Service:    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old male with history of multiple medical problems who was recently admitted to the  from  to  with projectile vomiting and hematocrit of 13.  He had negative hemolysis workup and negative EGD times two and a colonoscopy times one.  Found to have a right upper and right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.    filter was placed, and he was transferred to  Rehab and went home in late 01/.  He received seven units of packed red blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma, and one unit during previous hospitalization and two units of packed red blood cells while he was at .

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count of 13, hematocrit of 30, MCV of 90, platelets 272, sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, BUN 20, creatinine 1.0, glucose 149, CK 96, troponin 0.06.  EKG with sinus rhythm at 94 with normal axis; poor baseline; no other ST-T wave changes.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old man with multiple medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on  and represented with lower abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum and anemia.  1.  Gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia:  Most likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and polypectomy.  Patient had a negative EGD and then had a colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of previous polypectomy.  This was clipped with two clips with good control of the bleeding.  Patient's hematocrit remained stable.  He did receive a total of four units of packed red blood cells on this admission. After colonoscopy with clipping, no further melena or bright red blood per rectum was noted.  Patient's hematocrits were followed serially and remained in the 26, 27 range and eventually was transfused the fourth unit day prior to discharge, but his hematocrit remained 29 and 31 on day of discharge.  Otherwise, symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet, which he tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright red blood per rectum.  Patient was initially started on Protonix 40 intravenously b.i.d. as his EGD was negative.  Eventually was switched back to his 40 p.o. q. day regimen which he continued even as an outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Patient's blood pressure remained stable after transfused with blood.  He also had a negative tagged red cell scan and negative EGD.  Eventually, after colonoscopy, had a small bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as in his previous admission.  This was also negative.  Patient could not have a Meckel scan during this stay because of barium and can have it at least one week after barium ingestion.  Because of the recent colonoscopy and the bleed, patient's Lovenox dose and Coumadin dose were continued to be held. Patient's anticoagulation, including aspirin, Coumadin, and Lovenox, were to be held for at least one week and can be restarted on  per GI.  2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient's respiratory status was stable and at baseline.  Continued his home regimen of Advair, Combivent, and Theophylline and p.r.n. nebulizers as needed, although his pulmonary exam remained stable and he was at his baseline home oxygen of 2 liters and will be discharged on the same regimen.  3.  Status post lung cancer, status post pneumonectomy:  Was stable with tracheostomy.  Continued b.i.d. suctioning with good results.  Continue the Scopolamine patch for antiemetics.  4.  Prostate cancer:  He does have recently rising PSA most recently 8.9 in 02/.  Patient was eventually able to have a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative for metastases, only positive for previous post surgical bony changes.  Patient will be followed up with urologist, Dr. , in terms of his prostate cancer follow up.  5.  Troponin leak:  This was attributed to demand ischemia. He had negative EKG changes, and he had a catheterization in  which revealed 30% mid lesion but no flow-limiting disease.  His enzymes remained stable through the course of his stay and was attributed to his anemia.  Patient's aspirin was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted .  Patient was continued on his statin.  6.  Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was in sinus rhythm throughout the course of his stay and was stable on Amiodarone.  Again, his Coumadin was held for concerns with bleeding.  7.  Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus:  He has a history of  filter and right upper and right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  His hypercoagulable state is likely attributed to the prostate cancer, but otherwise his Coumadin was held for the bleeding reasons, and patient did have increasing amounts of swelling of his right upper and right lower extremity.  Patient was taken off his Lasix dose through the course of the stay because of concern for hemodynamic instability.  Was given p.r.n. doses of Lasix throughout the stay and continued to elevate his extremities with good results of them.  Patient did have both upper and lower extremity ultrasounds done to rule out new deep venous thrombosis.  The right lower extremity ultrasound was negative.  The right upper extremity did show the old known thrombus in the right basilic vein but no progression or change from previous studies, and this otherwise was stable throughout the course of his stay.  8.  Diabetes:  He has fairly good control with hemoglobin A1C most recently at 6.0.  He was continued on his home regimen of Glyburide once he was taking p.o. and covered with sliding scale as needed.  For his neuropathy patient was continued on his Tylenol Number 3 and was discharged with a prescription for Morphine sulfate per his request, although he was not continued on this during the course of his stay.  9.  Gout:  This was stable throughout the course of his admission, but patient was continued on his home dose of Colchicine.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed. 2.  Blood loss anemia. 3.  History of deep venous thrombosis. 4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 5.  Status post lung cancer. 6.  Status post prostate cancer. 7.  Atrial fibrillation. 8.

Brief Hospital Course: 64 year-old male with history of lung cancer post-right pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and  placement and antibiotic course for pneumonia, now returns from  rehab with diarrhea, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, and sepsis. No source of infection had been identified so far. He was C-diff negative, blood/urine/sputum culture had not yield any organism. He was treated empirically with ceftazidime, vancomycin and metronidazole for 7 days. His blood pressure responded to fluid challenge and he has been normotensive since then. He was started on stress dose steroid which was weaned off. He was gradually weaned off ventilation and tolerated trach mask well.  His blood sugar was well controlled with glargine and sliding scale. He was also noted to have decubitus ulcer. Plastic surgery was consulted and felt that debridement was not necessary. Therefore, he was cotinued on wet to dry dressing, Kinair bed and his nutrition was optimized. He remiained in normal sinus rhythm and is on coumadin for history of atrial fibrillation.  He was very agitated in the ICU. He was weaned off fentanyl drip and put on fentanyl patch. He also was put on standing zyprexa and prn haldol, morphine. He was also on standing valium and was actually thought to be in benzo withdrawal as his wife claims that he was on valium at home.He is full code and his health care proxy is his wife.  .

Also with a Urinary Tract Infection.  Assessment/Plan: 64 year-old male w/ history of lung ca s/p right pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and   rehab with a flutter 2:1, leukocytosis, hypotension and UTI. . 1. Hypotension:   have been due to infection from UTI vs. symptomatic tachycardia. Responded to aggresive fluid resusciation and rate control. Remained normotensive for the rest of hospitalization. Of note, his blood pressures were lower in left arm and family reported that this is a  problem for him. . 2. Atrial Flutter: He has a known history of paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.His was initially in rapid Atrial Fluuter with 2:1 conduction. This initially responded to diltiazem. On hopital day #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with Electrophysiology service Amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem was stopped (as he had been on Amiodarone for 3.5 years in the past, and it had to be discontinued  due to bradycardia when lopressor was added).  He remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of the hospitalization. Plan is continue Amiodarone 400mg TID x 1 week then 400mg  x 1 week then 200mg po QD thereafter.  He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel blockers.  3. Respiratory Failure:  His chest x-ray showed no evidence of Pneumonia. Due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by respiraotory. An interventional Pulmonolgy consult was obtained due to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.  Dr.  recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to prevent further tracheamalacia-- he would be willing to change the trach to a foam-filled trach ( tube) in the future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to ventilate.  He was continued on PS as tolerated with periods of rest on Assist Control. . 4. Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: He was initally started on ceftriaxone which was changed to levofloxacin but given history of heart block to levo, he was changed to Bactrim to complete a 7-day course for complicated UTI. The Urine Culture grew Klebsiella which is sensitive to Bactrim.His foley catheter was discontinued. . 5.Acute Blood Loss Anemia: His baseline hematocrit was 28-30. He was initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3, his hematorcit dropped to 19.  due to extensive bleeding from site of central line, he was transfused 2 UPRBC and had an appropriate bump in his hematocrit. He was noted to have  guaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive bleeding from Internal Jugular catheter site into his trach/mouth. His hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient, and his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for trace blood. . 6. Bleeding from Central Line site. He is maintained on coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation and his inital INR was therapeutic. After IJ placement, he had continued oozing from IJ site leading to anemia with hct 19.   He was given FFP and vitamin K (0.5 mg iv) to reverse his coagultopathy. He should be restarted on coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation at rehab. . 5. Diabetes Mellitis: He was continued on glargine and regular insulin sliding scale. His sugars were in good control. . 6. Pain/anxiety/depression: He was continued on his outpatient doses of Fentanyl 75mcg/q72hours, Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil.   His pain is from his scaral decubitus ulcer. . 7. Sacral Decubitus: He was seen by wound care nurse and continued on DSD for sacral wound. . 8. Left Upper Extremity Swelling: He had U/S which showed... . 9. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: He was given lasix prn to keep fluid even. . 10.Code: FULL . 11. Dispo: Discharged to  Rehab. . 12. Access: The Right Internal Jugular Vein triple lumen catheter was not discontinued per  request. This was placed on . ------ Outstanding issues on discharge: 1.The pt was started on coumadin at 5 mg qday on day of discharge .  Please monitor his INR and adjust dose accordingly. 2.The pt has a swollen L arm and had U/S on day of discharge to r/o clot. No read has been given yet. Please call  to follow this up. Regardless, he is being restarted on anticoagulation which would be treatment of choice.

Patient unable to give a history at this time so obtained from records. Pt was admitted to  on  after an admission at  for a Klebsiella UTI and hypotension. Since his admission there, the pt has been alert and getting out of bed to the commode with assistance. On , the pt became lethargic and then gradually unresponsive. On , his BP decreased to 60 over palp and the pt was noted to be diaphoretic. He received a 500 cc bolus with an increase in his BP to 90/40. He remained unresponsive during this time. ABG showed 7.265/92.7/82 on an FiO2 of 0.50 with a temperature of 99.4. Of note, pt's triple lumen was placed . . Wife later arrived at the hospital and was able to provide additional history. She reports that he had been doing very well until Friday. They were working on weaning him and he was able to be on the trach mask for 1-2 hours at a time. However, on Friday, the pt felt mildly more SOB per his report. He was maintained exclusively on the vent over the rest of the weekend. Yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked "very scared" and would often stare at the ceiling. He also had periods of his eyes "rolling back in his head". He was occasionally responsive to her. She reports that they had been checking ABGs over the last 24 hours and his CO2 had been elevated. When they changed the vent settings to decrease the CO2, she felt that he was slightly less confused. She also notes that he was very diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen. The pt's BP has always been very low in his left arm and she reports that they just starting taking his pressure there due to a skin tear on the right. . In the ED, the pt's VS were, 99.8 85 80/60-L 150/80-R 20 100% AC 400/20/100%/PEEP 5. He received vancomyicin and zosyn. Pt was initially started on levophed for hypotension. However, after learning that his BP has always been considered to be abnormally low in the left arm, it was checked in the right and has been stable in the 120s off of pressors.

Nonspecific ST-T wave changes but no major changes since previous studies. . CXR- Stent projecting over the right brachiocephalic vein. Right lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal contours toward the right consistent with previous pneumonectomy. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural effusion. Slightly increased interstitial markings int he left lung which appear stable. No new left pneumo or focal consolidation. . Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or evidence of hydrocephalus. No evidence of a major CVA.  US upper extremity:IMPRESSION: 1) Nonocclusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein. 2) Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins  Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. The gallbladder is not distended. There is an 8-9 mm stone located at the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder wall is thickened. There are possible crystal or tiny cholesterol polyps located at the fundus of the gallbladder. No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The common duct is not dilated and measures 3 mm. Flow in the portal vein is anterograde. Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no focal abnormality.  IMPRESSION: Thickened gallbladder wall with a stone in the gallbladder neck in a nondistended gallbladder. In the proper clinical setting, these findings may be consistent with cholecystitis. They are not completely typical for acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall thickening may also be produced by third spacing of fluids. If there is continued clinical concern for cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be performed for further evaluation.  TECHNIQUE: CT images of the chest without the administration of IV contrast.  COMPARISON:  and .  FINDINGS: Soft tissue window images demonstrate changes of prior right pneumonectomy and mediastinal shift towards the right. There is no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is a left pleural effusion. The patient is intubated with a tracheostomy tube. A stent is again identified within the right brachiocephalic vein. The heart demonstrates coronary calcifications, but is normal in size. The main pulmonary artery appears prominent measuring 3.5 cm.  Lung window images demonstrate multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the left lung. No specific areas of cavitation are identified within these nodules. Atelectasis is also seen at the left lung base. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Septal thickening is seen throughout the left lung field. A small 3-mm nodule seen on the prior studies is again seen, though slightly difficult to discern given the surrounding septal thickening and nodular opacities. However, on the study from , this nodule was clearly seen and appears stable dating back to . The bronchi appear patent to the segmental level within the left lung.  Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate high-density material within dependent portion of the gallbladder, probably relating to sludge. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen within the stomach. The remainder of the visualized portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable other than arterial calcifications. The soft tissues are unremarkable. Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.  IMPRESSION: 1) Multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the entire left lung. These most likely represent aspiration pneumonia. Septic emboli are considered less likely based on the CT appearance. 2) Mild CHF. 3) Left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of  demonstrates stability dating back to . 4) Probable sludge within the gallbladder. 5) Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.   Brief Hospital Course: 65 y/o man with PMH significant for squamous cell lung CA, type 2 DM, atrial fib, and multiple past pneumonias admitted from  with mental status change and hypotension.  #ID/sepsis Patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating blood pressure, lactate 1.3. His blood pressure in the ED was measured on the left arm (which is typically much lower). His blood pressure on the right was found to be normal and pressors were off. Sputum culture was sent(colonized with pseudomonas), blood culture, urine culture and cath tip culture negative on discharge. His decubitus ulcer looks clean. His line was resited line to the right femoral. Chest CT was consistent with aspiration pneumonia. He will be continued on zosyn for 14 days. He remained afebrile and no pressors required throughout the rest of his hospital stay.  #Mental status changes: His mental status improved with decreasing CO2 and also with narcan. His CO2 remained well controlled in the hospital and was at baseline in 70s. CT head was negative. Narcotics was taken into consideration as possible cause of mental status changes. Patient's duragesic patch was removed in the ED.  #anemia/coagulation Patient has history of deep venous thrombosis with IVC filter and SVC clot and also atrial fibrillation for which he was on coumadin. COumadin was taken off 3 days prior to hospital admission because he had blood oozing from his trach and foley. In hospital, central line was attempted intially on the right subclavian but the artery was puctured. His right femoral artery was also punctured and he did lose a signifcant amount of blood. The 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no hematoma. He also got an ultrasound of uppper extremity which revealed DVT in left arm for which he was started on heparin drip. He then had mild guiac negative stool and oozing from arterial line site. Heparin drip was then stopped and he was given 2 unit of transfusion. His hematocrit had been stable since then. On discharge, coumadin was not restarted. It should be restarted in 1-2days time if the hematocrit remain stable. . #transaminitis He presented intially with transaminitis likely from hypotension. LFTS trended down on discharge. RUQ ultrasound was done which showed gallstone at neck of GB, no distension, thickened gallbladder. He remained afebrile and has no abdominal tenderness  #respiratory: Patient has squamous cell lung CA post right pneumonectomy and post tracheostomy. During his past admission there was concern about cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia. Dr.  recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to prevent further tracheamalacia. Possible change the trach to a foam-filled trach ( tube) in the future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to ventilate. He remained on assist control ventilation. . #  Pt with mildly elevated Na at 148. This is most likely due to water deficit as he can not drink to replace his needs. He recieved free water through G tube. . # Cardiac Patient has long history of atypical chest pain but has no such complain during this hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes were unremarkable. He was continued on aspirin and also amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel blockers because of profound bradycardia. . #Type 2 diabetes mellitus Patient was continued on standing 8U glargine and sliding scale while in hospital.  #Anxiety/pain Patient's family reports that he is extemely anxious at baseline. He was continues on his outpatient doses of Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil. His pain is from his scaral decubitus ulcer and back pain. Anxiety has been severely worsened in the past with ativan. Would avoid further ativan. Fentanyl patch was discontinued since there was a concern regarding narcotic overdose. He was on prn morphine. THis should be adjusted in .  # Sacral Decubitus: He had Kinair bed  # FEN Tube feeds was continued with no residual  #access He had picc line on discharge  #code OK with pressor, do not resuscitate(confirmed again with family meeting)   Medications on Admission: 1.
